# Test Coverage Requirements

- Minimum 80% test coverage on risk scoring model (`test_integrated_models.py`), data adapters, and all validation logic.
- Run `pytest --cov` or `coverage run` on all files in `tests/` and top-level `test_*.py`.
- Add/extend tests as you add features or refactor code.
